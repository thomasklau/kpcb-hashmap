/* File: cmap.h
 * ------------
 * Defines the interface for the CMap type.
 *
 * The CMap manages a collection of key-value pairs or "entries". The keys
 * are always of type char *, but the values can be of any desired type. The
 * main operations are to associate a value with a key and to retrieve
 * the value associated with a key.  In order to work for all types of values,
 * all CMap values must be passed and returned via (void *) pointers.
 * Given its extensive use of untyped pointers, the CMap is a bit tricky
 * to use correctly as a client. Be diligent!

 /**
  * Type: CleanupValueFn
  * --------------------
  * CleanupValueFn is the typename for a pointer to a client-supplied
  * cleanup function. The client passes a cleanup function to cmap_create
  * and the CMap will apply that function to a value that is being
  * removed/replaced/disposed. The cleanup function takes one void* pointer
  * that points to the value.
  *
  * The typedef allows the nickname "CleanupValueFn" to stand in for the
  * longer declaration.  CleanupValueFn can be used as the declared type
  * for a variable, parameter, struct field, and so on.

/**
 * Type: CMap
 * ----------
 * Defines the CMap type. The type is "incomplete", i.e. deliberately
 * avoids stating the field names/types for the struct CMapImplementation.
 * (That struct is completed in the implementation code not visible to
 * clients). The incomplete type forces the client to respect the privacy
 * of the representation. Client declare variables only of type CMap *
 * (pointers only, never of the actual struct) and cannot never dereference
 * a CMap * nor attempt to read/write its internal fields. A CMap
 * is manipulated solely through the functions listed in this interface
 * (this is analogous to how you use a FILE *).
 */
typedef struct CMapImplementation CMap;


/**
 * Function: cmap_create
 * Usage: CMap *m = cmap_create(sizeof(int), 10, NULL)
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 * Creates a new empty CMap and returns a pointer to it. The pointer
 * is to storage allocated in the heap. When done with the CMap, the
 * client must call cmap_dispose to dispose of it. If allocation fails, an
 * assert is raised.
 *
 * The valuesz parameter specifies the size, in bytes, of the type of
 * values that will be stored in the CMap. For example, to store values of
 * type double, the client passes sizeof(double) for the valuesz. All values
 * stored in a given CMap must be of the same type. An assert is raised
 * if valuesz is not greater than zero.
 *
 * The capacity_hint parameter allows the client to tune the resizing behavior.
 * The CMap's internal storage will initially be optimized to hold
 * the number of entries hinted. This capacity_hint is not a binding limit.
 * Whenever the capacity is outgrown, the capacity automatically enlarges.
 * If planning to store many entries, specifying a large capacity_hint will
 * result in an appropriately large initial allocation and fewer resizing
 * operations later.  For a small map, a small capacity_hint will result in
 * several smaller allocations and potentially less waste.  If capacity_hint
 * is 0, an internal default value is used. An assert is raised if capacity_hint
 * is negative.
 *
 * The fn is a client callback that will be called on a value being
 * removed/replaced (via cmap_remove/cmap_put, respectively) and on every value
 * in the CMap when it is destroyed (via cmap_dispose). The client can use this
 * function to do any deallocation/cleanup required for the value, such as
 * freeing memory to which the value points (if the value is or contains a
 * pointer). The client can pass NULL for fn if values don't require any
 * cleanup.

 * being overwritten, the client's cleanup function is called on the old value.
 * addr is expected to be a valid pointer and the new value is copied
 * from the memory pointed to by addr. The key string is copied and stored
 * internally by the CMap. Note that keys are compared case-sensitively,

 * returned as a sentinel.  Note this function returns a pointer into the
 * CMap's storage, so the pointer should be used with care. In particular,
 * the pointer returned by cmap_get can become invalid during a call that adds
 * or removes entries within the CMap.  Note that keys are compared

 * starts an iteration with a call to cmap_first which returns the first
 * key of the CMap or NULL if the CMap is empty. The client loop calls
 * cmap_next passing the previous key and receives the next key in the iteration
 * or NULL if there are no more keys. Keys are iterated in arbitrary order.
 * The argument to cmap_next is expected to be a valid pointer to a key string
 * as returned by a previous call to cmap_first/cmap_next. The CMap supports
 * multiple iterations at same time without interference, however, the client
 * should not add/remove/rearrange CMap entries in the midst of iterating.
